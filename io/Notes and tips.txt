Notes and tips
============================================
1. Overriding the Object clone method didn't work and just seems to wait forever. 

2. Be careful when formatting the code as sometimes it can prevent the code from working. E.g. try put ifFalse on a new line in unless.io

3. To use code from another file (similar to java's import), use the command doFile('Path_of_file') to evaluate the code in that file.
